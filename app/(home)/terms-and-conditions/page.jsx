                        objects outside, or leaning out of the windows. Smoking and drinking alcohol in the vehicle are
                        strictly forbidden. Violations may result in cleaning charges or compensation for downtime.

                        We work hard to keep our platform accurate and reliable, but mistakes happen. Sometimes, there
                        might be a typo or an outdated piece of information. We fix these as quickly as possible. To
                        improve your experience, we also update our content, features, and services from time to
                        timeâ€”often without prior notice.

                                We follow UAE laws since that&apos;s where we&apos;re based. Payments on OneTapDrive are safe and
                                secure due to SSL encryption and a trusted payment gateway. You can pay using Visa or
                                MasterCard in AED (United Arab Emirates Dirham). Before completing your transaction,
                                it&apos;s a good idea to review the terms and policies of your payment provider.

                                payment. Depending on your bank, this may take up to 45 days.

                        work. If anything changes, it&apos;ll be official only if it&apos;s put in writing by OneTapDrive. It&apos;s a

                        downtime. No guarantees are provided against service interruptions, and the right to modify,
                        pause, or discontinue any part of the Platform, including user access, is reserved.
