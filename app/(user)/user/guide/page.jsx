            </h3>
            <p>
                All rental cars are subject to a deposit. It’s always best to use a credit card to make the deposit. This ensures that the deposit will be released automatically after 20-30 days. Banks can also help you get it faster if needed.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Insurance
            </h3>
            <p>
                All rental companies found on our marketplace offer standard insurance inclusive of the price. However, you can opt for Collision Damage Waiver (Additional Coverage) for an additional fee. This also varies from company to company.

                        Please be sure to check the rental car at the time of delivery. Take photos and videos of any dents, scratches or tears before you ride. If there are already defects, please report them beforehand to avoid any misunderstandings later.
